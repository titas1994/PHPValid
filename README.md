# PHPValidation
In this Repository I add some PHP code to check the username available or not  and validate all others fields. I also show them in a table format
# Form validatation :- Username,Password,Password encription, Phone Number
# In this code if the username or phone number already exit into the database then the data is not inserted into the database
# I use salt function and hash function to encript the password
# Also the username and password is SQL injection proof.
